### This repository aims to help code beginners with their first successful pull request and open source contribution. :partying_face:

:star: Feel free to use this project to make your first contribution to an open-source project on GitHub. Practice making your first pull request to a public repository before doing the real thing!

:star: Make sure to grab some cool swags during Hacktoberfest by getting involved in the open-source community.

### This repository is open to all members of the GitHub community. Any member can contribute to this project! :grin:

## What is Hacktoberfest? :thinking:
A month-long celebration from October 1st to October 31st presented by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) collaborated with [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest) to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open-source developer community.

[https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

## Rules :fire:
To qualify for the __official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt__, you must register [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and make four Pull Requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2022 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repository on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. This year, the __first 40,000__ participants who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.


# My-Name
This is a Project I created for anyone just starting out in CSS and Open-Source. The Project as of now contains an example div, you can add a similar section with your name and something about yourself, or you could go all the way and add something extra too. Consider this a learning exercise and your initial step into the world of contribution and Open-Source. If you like the idea of this project make sure to share it with your friends. You can see what the Web Page currently looks like, [here](https://vansh-goel.github.io/My-Name/)
